• CMOS is also sometimes referred to as complementary symmetry metal oxide semiconductor (or 
COS-MOS). The words "complementary-symmetry" refer to the fact that the typical digital design 
style with CMOS uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type metal oxide 
semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFETs) for logic functions.  A voltage controlled 
oscillator or VCO is an electronic oscillator designed for producing oscillation frequency by a 
controlled input voltage. The frequency of oscillation is varied by the applied controlled 
voltage. A voltage controlled oscillator or VCO is an electronic oscillator designed for 
producing oscillation frequency by a controlled input voltage. The frequency of oscillation is 
varied by the applied controlled voltage. 

•A VCO plays a vital role in communication system, providing a periodic signal required 
for digital circuit and also a frequency transmission in digital circuit. Their output 
frequency is a function of control input voltage. An ideal VCO is a circuit whose output 
frequency is a linear function of its control voltage. Most of the application as required a 
variable control input voltage as they required different frequency. 


• The voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) plays a very important role in communication systems 
due to low power consumption, wide frequency range of operation and its high integration 
capability.

•It is an electronic device that uses amplification, feedback, and a resonant circuit to generate a repeating voltage waveform at a particular frequency. The frequency, or rate of repetition per unit time, is variable with an applied voltage. VCOs are important integral part of phase locked loops, clock recovery circuits, frequency synthesizers and in almost all digital and analog systems. 


• Phase locked loops (PLLs) are common applications for VCOs based frequency synthesizer is 
usually used in RF transceivers. PLLs can be used for clock generations, such as in a 
microprocessor, clock and Data recovery, such as in an optical transmission system, or frequency synthesis, such as in a wireless radio. 

•The general characteristic for VCOs used in PLL is wide tuning range so that the entire frequency range is covered.Also, the phase noise requirement of the VCO can be loosened due to that when the loop is locked, the noise generated by the VCO at the center of oscillation frequency will be filtered out by the loop bandwidth. As a result, PLLs generally use wide tuning range and noisier ring topology VCO.

# Working principle: 
A ring oscillator is comprised of a number of delay stages, with the output of the last stage fed back to the input of the first.

This current starved VCO is designed using ring oscillator and its operation is also similar to that. From the schematic circuit shown in the Figure 7, it is observed that MOSFETs M1 and M2 operate as an inverter, while MOSFETs M13 and M14 operate as current sources. 

The current sources, M13 and M14, limit the current available to the inverter M1 and M2. 
In other words, the inverter is starved for the current. The MOSFETs M11 and M12 drain currents 
are the same and are set by input control voltage. The currents in M11 and M12 are mirrored in each inverter/current source stage. The upper PMOS transistors are connected to the gate of M11 and source voltage is applied to the gates of all low NMOS Transistors. 

The bias circuit is used to provide correct polarization for transistor M13 and M14. The benefit of this configuration is that the oscillation frequency can be tuned for a wide range by changing the value of control voltage. 

# RESULT ANALYSIS 
• Software tool used: Cadence virtuoso 
Cadence Virtuoso is a comprehensive Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool suite used for 
the design, simulation, verification, and layout of integrated circuits (ICs), particularly analog, RF 
(radio frequency), and mixed-signal ICs. Virtuoso is one of the leading tools used in the 
semiconductor industry for designing custom ICs and is especially well-suited for designing and 
simulating analog circuits and custom layouts. 
 
# Procedure: 
Creating a VCO (Voltage-Controlled Oscillator) schematic in Cadence Virtuoso for a 180nm technology 
node involves several steps, including designing the circuit, selecting the appropriate components, performing 
simulations, and verifying the layout. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to create a VCO schematic in 
Cadence Virtuoso. 
Step-by-Step Procedure to Create a VCO Schematic in Cadence Virtuoso (180nm): 
1. Set Up Cadence Virtuoso Environment 
Before you start designing, make sure the Cadence Virtuoso environment is set up correctly. 
1. Launch Cadence Virtuoso: 
a. Open Cadence Virtuoso by running the Virtuoso Layout Editor or Virtuoso Schematic 
Editor. 
b. Set up your design environment using the Library Manager. 
2. Create a New Library: 
a. Open the Library Manager and create a new library for your VCO design. 
b. You will need to associate your library with the 180nm process technology. This is typically 
done by specifying the Technology File or PDK (Process Design Kit) provided by your 
foundry (e.g., TSMC, UMC). 
3. Create a New Cell View: 
a. In the Library Manager, create a new cell under your library (e.g., VCO). 
b. Choose Schematic as the cell type and click OK. 
2. Design the VCO Schematic 
Now, let's start designing the VCO circuit. We'll design a simple CMOS VCO as an example, which is a 
common architecture for voltage-controlled oscillators in analog IC design. 
1. Open the Schematic Editor: 
a. Open the schematic editor by selecting your newly created cell (e.g., VCO). 
b. Click Create > Instance to add components to your schematic. 
2. Select Components for the VCO Design: You can design a simple CMOS VCO using the following 
components: 
a. MOSFETs (n-channel and p-channel) for the oscillator core. 
b. Resistors and capacitors for the tank circuit. 
c. Voltage source (V_control) to control the oscillation frequency. 
d. Biasing components (e.g., resistors, current sources) to set the operating points of the 
transistors. 
To add these components: 
e. Click Create > Instance. 
f. Search for the components you need in the Library (e.g., nmos, pmos, resistor, 
capacitor). 
g. Place the components on the schematic sheet. 
h. For an RC VCO: You would replace the inductor with a resistor to determine the frequency. 
 
3. Connect the MOSFETs in a Negative Feedback Loop: 
a. Use nMOS and pMOS transistors to create the oscillator core. 
b. Connect the drain of the nMOS transistor to the capacitor and the positive feedback loop to the 
gate of the pMOS transistor. 
4. Add Control Voltage: 
a. The control voltage (V_control) is connected to the gate of one of the MOSFETs (typically the 
nMOS transistor). This will control the frequency of the VCO by adjusting the gate voltage and 
thus the operating point of the transistors. 
5. Output Node: 
a. The output of the VCO can be taken from the drain of the nMOS transistor or the pMOS 
transistor. 
b. You can add an output buffer (e.g., a CMOS inverter) to ensure the signal is clean and stable.
